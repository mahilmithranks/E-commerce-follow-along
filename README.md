üìå Installation & Setup

1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (Download from nodejs.org)

npm (Comes with Node.js) or yarn

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

If you haven‚Äôt set up Tailwind CSS and React Router DOM yet, follow these steps:
# Create a new React project (if not already created)
npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project

# Install Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

# Install React Router DOM
npm install react-router-dom
3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Tailwind CSS
Add the following to tailwind.config.js:
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};

4Ô∏è‚É£ Include Tailwind in index.css

Replace the contents of src/index.css with:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

5Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up React Router

Modify src/App.js to include routing:
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;

6Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Project
npm start

The app will run on: http://localhost:5176/


# üìå Milestone 3: Backend Setup & Folder Structure

In this milestone, we focused on structuring the backend, setting up the server, connecting to MongoDB, and implementing basic error handling.

## üöÄ Key Features

### ‚úÖ **Backend Folder Structure**
A well-organized backend directory following MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:


### ‚úÖ **Server Setup**
- Configured a backend server using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- Implemented a **REST API** with Express routes.
- Server listens on a designated port and handles requests efficiently.

### ‚úÖ **MongoDB Integration**
- Connected the backend to **MongoDB** using Mongoose.
- Established a **database connection** to handle product and user data.
- Created Mongoose models for structured data storage.

### ‚úÖ **Error Handling**
- Implemented a centralized error-handling system in `utils/errorHandler.js`.
- Provided **clear error messages** to improve debugging and user feedback.
